<p><strong>Welcome to Web Editor.</strong> My name is Marouane (creater of Web Editor) and I will walk you through, how to use Web Editor and get your first script running. First of all I recommend editing your scripts in a different code editor, since I haven't yet made a saving feature for the editor in the add-code section.</p>
<h3>Writing your first script:</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you haven't programmed before I recommend visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp</a>&nbsp;and learn with w3schools tutorials AND you can watch tutotial on youtube too they really help alot. The programming language is called JavaScript and will run on webpages immediatly after it has loaded. The code will run on just like code being inserted into the console.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to the add code section.</li>
<li>Choose the URL-matching. The code will run on pages where the URL of the webpage equals or/and contains the URL-match.</li>
<li>Paste or (write) your JavaScript code into the "your code" section.</li>
<li>Click add code.</li>
<li>Now the code will run on webpage matching with the URL-match.</li>
<li>If your code contains an error you will be able to see the error message in the console (press F12) of websites that matches with the URL-match.</li>
</ol>
