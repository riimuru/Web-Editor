Welcome to The Code Adder. My name is Marouane (creater of The Code Adder) and I will walk you through, how to use Codify and get your first script running. First of all I recommend editing your scripts in a different code editor, since I haven't yet made a saving feature for the editor in the add-code section. __If you think the UI is really bad I'm sorry for that. I'm working to improve on it.__

# First of all 
if you don't know how to unpack extention Follow the steps to load the unpacked extension:<br />
Go to Chrome Settings using three dots on the top right corner.<br />
Now, Enable developer mode.<br />
Click on Load Unpacked and select your Unzip folder. Note: You need to select the folder in which the manifest file exists.<br />
The extension will be loaded now.<br />

# **Writing your first script:**
If this is your first time writing your first script I would recommend visiting https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp and learn with w3schools tutorial AND you can watch tutotial on youtube too they really help alot. The programming language is called JavaScript and will run on webpages immediatly after it has loaded. The code will run on just like code being inserted into the console. 

# **Instructions:**
Go to the add code section.<br />
Choose the URL-matching. The code will run on pages where the URL of the webpage equals or/and contains the URL-match.<br />
Paste or (write) your JavaScript code into the "Your Code" section.<br />
Click add code.<br />
Now the code will run on webpage matching with the URL-match.<br />
If your code contains an error you will be able to see the error message in the console (press F12) of websites that matches with the URL-match.<br />
