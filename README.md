Welcome to The Code Adder. My name is Marouane (creater of The Code Adder) and I will walk you through, how to use Codify and get your first script running. First of all I recommend editing your scripts in a different code editor, since I haven't yet made a saving feature for the editor in the add-code section.

**Writing your first script:**
If you haven't programmed before I recommend visiting https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp and learn with w3schools tutorial. The programming language is called JavaScript and will run on webpages immediatly after it has loaded. The code will run on just like code being inserted into the console. 

**Instructions:**
Go to the add code section.
Choose the URL-matching. The code will run on pages where the URL of the webpage equals or/and contains the URL-match.
Paste or (write) your JavaScript code into the "your code" section.
Click add code.
Now the code will run on webpage matching with the URL-match.
If your code contains an error you will be able to see the error message in the console (press F12) of websites that matches with the URL-match.

**Future optimizations:**
Autosave the state of the editor.
Implementation of regular expressions as the URL-match.
Ability to edit already created scripts in the "manage your code" section.
Better UI.
Better options for debugging.
Interactive mode.
If you have any questions or suggestions for The Code Adder, then feel free to DM me on my discord sinon#5255. I am working hard to optimize in any possible way. 

If you enjoy using Codify then feel free to leave a review as well.
